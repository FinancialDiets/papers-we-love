  Programmers are used to counting boring things. Why not count something more interesting for a change?

* [:scroll:] [graph isomorphism and representation theory](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/mathematics/daniel litt. graph isomorphism and representation theory. graphs-sl2.pdf) by Daniel Litt

    Programmers work with graphs often (file system, greplin, trees, "graph isomorphism problem" (who cares) ).   But have you ever tried to construct a simpler building-block (basis) with which graphs could be built? Or at least a different building block to build the same old things.
    
    This <10-page paper also uses `𝔰𝔩₂(ℂ)`, a simple mathematical object you haven’t heard of, but which is a nice lead-in to an area of real mathematics—rep theory—that (1) contains actual insights (1a) that you aren’t using (2) is simple (3) isn’t pretentious.

* [:scroll:] [Conway's ZIP proof](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/mathematics/francis + weeks ZIP proof.pdf) by francis + weeks

    This paper can be shown to college freshmen because
    * it’s pictorial
    * it’s about an object you mightn’t have considered mathematical
    * no calculus, crypto, ML, or pretentious notation
    * it’s short
    * it’s a classification proof: “How can it be that you know something about _all possible_ `X`, even the `xϵX` you haven’t seen yet?’

  This is a higher-level paper, but still a survey (so more readable). It ties together disparate areas like Platonic solids (A-D-E), Milnor’s exceptional fibre, and algebra.

  It has pictures and you’ll get a better sense of what mathematics is like from skimming it.

  You do sorting all the time. Are there smart ways to organise sub-sorts?

  Recently there have been some papers posted about tropical geometry of neural nets. Tropical is also said to be derived from CS. This is a good introduction.
